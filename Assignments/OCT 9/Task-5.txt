     i)WINDOW:
	   # Window is an top level heirarchy in javascript and window consist of number of objects in it as properties and DOCUMENT and SCREEN are one of the objects
in Window among all. 
	   # Window represent the complete things about browsers window.
	   # All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
	   # Global variables are properties of the window object.
	   # Global functions are methods of the window object.
	   # There are lot of properties in window object.
	Example:we can determine the size of the browser window by using below property.

      ii)DOCUMENT:
	   # DOCUMENT is the actual content of the page i.e the html page that we are loading is converted to the DOM object [Document object Model].
	   # When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
	   # The HTML DOM will be created as TREE MODEL 
	   # Java script connects with the HTML and CSS using the DOM OBJECT.
	   # Java Script can manipulate all the elements using DOM object. 
	   # There are several properties in DOCUMENT.
	Example:
		  document.getElementById(“header”);  // gives the value of header
	          
		  As document is property of window the above code is same as
		  window.document.getElementById(“header”);  // gives the value of header.
