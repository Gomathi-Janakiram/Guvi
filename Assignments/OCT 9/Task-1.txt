 	 i)ARRAYS: If we have to copy by value in arrays,we can use slice() operation.Basically, the slice() operation clones the array and returns a 
reference to a new array.
                  EXAMPLE:
        		var a=[1,2,3,"hai"]
			var b=a   //assigning a to b
			b
	 		 >>>(4) [1, 2, 3, "hai"]
	
        		b[3]="hello!"
			a
			 >>>(4) [1, 2, 3, "hello!"]  //We have changed b but a has also changed due to Call by Reference.

       
        		var c=a.slice()    //assigning a to c. Slice clones the array and gives the reference to new array.
        		c[3]="Welcome"   
        		c
			 >>>(4) [1, 2, 3, "Welcome"]

        		a
			 >>>(4) [1, 2, 3, "hello!"] //We have changed c but a is not affected.Bahaves as if it is primitive datatype (Call by Value).

	  ii)OBJECTS: If we have to copy by value in objects,we can convert the object to a string and then parse it.By doing this,changing the values of the 
variable which is assigned to the original will not change the original variable.
                 EXAMPLE:
			var orig={"name":"original","age":"20"}
			var dup=orig;   //assigning orig object to dup
			dup["name"]="duplicate"
   			orig
			 >>>{name: "duplicate", age: "20"}

			var dummy=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dup))  //Now dummy will contain dup 
			dummy["name"]="dummy"
			dummy
			 >>>{name: "dummy", age: "20"} 
			
			dup
			 >>>{name: "duplicate", age: "20"}   //We have changed dummy but this did not affect dup...
